    <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.
        There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.
        I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream;
        I like to talk, I like to listen.
        I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing
        on my face
